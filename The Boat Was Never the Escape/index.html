  <h1>The Boat Was Never the Escape</h1>

  <p>
    There has been a boat somewhere in my mind for most of my adult life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes it was very concrete — drawings, measurements, magazines stacked
    next to a bed. Sometimes it was only a dream image: a sailboat moving quietly,
    a sense of order, a place where things made sense again. Whenever life became
    cramped or incoherent, the boat returned.
  </p>

  <p>
    For a long time I thought this meant I wanted <em>a better boat</em>. Bigger,
    stronger, more capable. If I could just get the right one, everything else
    would line up.
  </p>

  <p>
    That turned out not to be true.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have built a boat. I have sailed one. I have sold one. I have lived the
    fantasy version and the ordinary, disappointing version. What I learned is
    this:
    <strong>the boat is not the cure — it is the container.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    A container for time.<br>
    A container for solitude.<br>
    A container for responsibility, and for freedom that doesn’t ask permission.
  </p>

  <p>
    This site is not about how to sail around the world. There are already many
    people doing that very well. It is about what draws people toward that life
    in the first place — and what actually happens after the dream starts behaving
    like reality.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am in the later part of my life. I am not chasing achievement, influence, or
    reinvention. I am interested in <em>alignment</em>: between how a life looks on
    the outside and how it feels on the inside. Between independence and
    connection. Between solitude and loneliness — which are not the same thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll find here:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>essays about boats, time, work, money, and meaning</li>
    <li>reflections on autonomy without heroics</li>
    <li>notes from a life that has tried things, abandoned others, and learned slowly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some of this will resonate. Some of it won’t. That’s fine. This is not a
    program or a philosophy. It’s a record of thinking things through honestly,
    without pretending that freedom is simple or that solitude is always noble.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’re here because a boat keeps appearing in your own thoughts — literal
    or metaphorical — you’re not alone. And you’re not necessarily running away.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes you’re just looking for a structure strong enough to hold who you
    already are.
