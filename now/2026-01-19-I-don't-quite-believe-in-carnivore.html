In response to:  </font><font color="#555555">Very
many YouTube Videos proposing that th</font><span lang="en-US">e </span><span lang="en-US">(to
quote Google), “</span><span lang="en-US">carnivore diet is </span><span lang="en-US"><b>an
extremely restrictive diet that's grown in popularity mostly via
social media as a quick way to lose weight over the last few years</b></span><span lang="en-US">.
It's made up of only animal products: meat, fish, seafood, eggs and
some dairy products like butter.”</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">I have several objections, tested not only on
myself, but also supported by research.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">First I want to state my purely emotional
objections. There is a country called France where people love to
eat. They are known over the world for their cuisine. They also love
to drink, and even smoke their Gualoises. They have many other habits
that are known to shorten life, such as engaging in desert warfare
(“The French Foreign Legion”), sleeping with other people’s
spouses, spending whole afternoons having lunch, and being nice to
the English.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">Yet they live long. They produce writers,
musicians, painters, and philosophers. They had a revolution that
invented the idea of “democracy”. They happily chopped off the
heads of those who disagreed, and a few more. Once one gets worked
up, in a crowd, it’s hard to stop. So a few of those philosophers
may also have been shortened by a head. But there’s always more.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">If one starts to study the French way to
prepare your food, the first skill you have to master, is “chopping
up vegetables”. </span><span lang="en-US">The second skill is
preparing a lovely soup. Perhaps an onion soup. And so it goes.</span></p>
<p><a name="_1hJuabbyBZekhbIPmNWM4AU_53"></a><span lang="en-US">When
studying French cousine, it is easy to come across an American couple
visiting Paris, and meeting French food. They are fairly large
people, because back at home there’s a bit of a crisis. Instead of
eating small quantities, very well prepared, which is the French way,
the poor dear Americans go the other way. Huge quantities prepared as
“take-outs”. Uber Eats. You don’t have to get off your couch.
Whereas the Frenchman has to jump up every morning and go buy his
“</span><span lang="en-US">baguette</span><span lang="en-US">”
with some fresh ham and cheese, and perhaps some tomato and garden
salad.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">Now, recently, the “carnivore diet” has ben
proposed as a solution to the overdose of carbohydrates that the
wealthy countries eat. Eat more meat. Just eat animal products.
Vegetables are bad for you. They contain glucose, that will give you
heart attacks. And, you can eat as much as you like. So now, we see
everyone stuffing themselves on the best grass fed steaks. It’s
actually a bit sicking. Especially if you read the comments. “After
eating just the best quality free range chicken eggs, wild-caught
salmon and grass fed beef burgers for a month, no vegetables and
fruit at all, and no bread, my weight went from 380 lbs to 350 lbs.
This is amazing. </span><span lang="en-US">At this rate I will be
thin again in 6 months.”</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">One may argue, that the animals benefit. The
chickens roam free, the steers eat high qulity food, and the salmon
don’t live in farms. Yes, but then they’re eaten. Perhaps not
ther life goal they had in mind.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-US">So that’s my feeling about the carnivore
diet. Don’t become a glutton. If yu are one, take up French
Cuisine. Not just eating it, but preparing it. Go stand in the
kitchen and start chopping. Make all your own food to the highest
standards. You will get to know your carrots, cabbage, and salad, as
well as your fish and beef steak. But you will treat them with
respect. And when you eat them, they will give you pleasure, but not
of a gluttony kind. You will eat them with distinction and taste. And
your body will show the results.</span></p>
