Fill in the blanks

Write in one sitting

Edit once

Publish or delete

No refactoring. No styling tweaks per entry.
Consistency beats elegance.

Step 1 — Define minimum rhythm

Goal: 1 /now/ entry every 3 days (adjustable later)

Constraint: No partial drafts. Publish only when you reach your word threshold (~600 words is fine)

Step 2 — Add to your system

Calendar trigger: mark every third day as /now/ writing day.

Reminder: At the start of the day, check if /now/ is due.

Write, publish, done: no revisions, no hesitation.

Step 3 — Feedback loop

After two weeks, evaluate:

Were you able to consistently hit the 3-day mark?

Was the word count manageable?

Did internal pressure feel lighter or heavier?

Adjust cadence up or down based on those observations.
