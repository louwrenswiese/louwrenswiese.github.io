That’s a lovely set of subjects — and yes, **they are exactly the kind of material Wikimedia Commons wants**. I’ll walk you through this **calmly, correctly, and without jargon**, so you feel confident uploading *once* and doing it right.

We’ll cover:

1. What Commons accepts (and why your content fits)
2. Licensing choice (the important bit)
3. Preparing your files
4. Uploading step by step
5. Writing good descriptions (this matters more than people think)
6. Common mistakes to avoid

---

## 1. First: Does Your Content Belong on Wikimedia Commons?

**Yes**, absolutely.

Your examples:

* 🚆 **Historic diesel train running between hills** → documentary, educational
* 🐦 **Swallows on a power pole** → wildlife / rural life
* 🏞 **Hills and gravel roads** → geography / landscape

Commons is *not* about art or aesthetics — it’s about **documenting the world**. Your photos and video do exactly that.

---

## 2. Licensing: The One Decision That Matters

Because **you took the photos/video yourself**, you own the copyright.

That means **you choose the license**.

### Recommended license for you

✔ **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 (CC BY-SA 4.0)**

Why:

* Very common on Commons
* Allows Wikipedia, educators, and creators to use it
* Requires attribution (which you like)
* Matches how Commons already works

You can also choose:

* **CC BY 4.0** (no share-alike)
* **CC0** (public domain — no attribution required)

But I think **CC BY-SA** fits your values.

👉 Important:
Once uploaded, **you can’t revoke the license**, so only upload what you’re happy to share.

---

## 3. Prepare Your Files (Before Upload)

### Photos

* JPG is perfect
* Don’t over-edit (Commons prefers natural images)
* Original resolution is good (no need to downscale)

### Video

* MP4 works
* Keep it uncut or lightly edited
* Sound is fine (train horn = documentary value)

Rename files clearly *before upload*:

* `Diesel_train_hills_region_year.jpg`
* `Swallows_power_pole_rural_area.jpg`
* `Gravel_road_hills_region.jpg`
* `Diesel_train_hills_video.mp4`

Commons filenames should be **descriptive**, not personal.

---

## 4. Uploading to Wikimedia Commons (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Create / Log in to a Wikimedia account

Same account works for:

* Wikipedia
* Wikimedia Commons

### Step 2: Go to Wikimedia Commons → Upload

Click **“Upload file”**
Choose **“Upload your own work”**

### Step 3: Confirm ownership

Tick:

> *This file is my own work*

---

## 5. Filling In the Upload Form (This Is the Core)

For **each file**, you’ll fill in:

### A) Description (Very Important)

Write plainly and factually.

**Example — Train photo**

> A diesel locomotive travelling through hilly countryside, sounding its horn while passing through a rural area.

**Example — Swallows**

> Swallows perched on a power pole in a rural area.

**Example — Gravel road**

> A gravel road winding through hilly countryside.

No poetry. Commons prefers **clear documentation**.

---

### B) Date

* When you took the photo/video (approximate is OK)

---

### C) Location (If Known)

Optional but valuable:

* Country
* Region
* “Rural area near [town/area]”

Don’t give precise GPS if you’re uncomfortable.

---

### D) Author

Your real name or username (consistent across uploads).

---

### E) License

Select:

* **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0**

---

### F) Categories (Crucial)

This determines whether your upload gets *used*.

Examples:

* `Diesel locomotives`
* `Railways in [Country]`
* `Rural landscapes`
* `Swallows`
* `Birds on power lines`
* `Gravel roads`

Commons will suggest categories — accept the good ones.

---

## 6. For the Video (Small Extra Notes)

* Commons accepts video happily
* Add categories like:

  * `Diesel locomotives in operation`
  * `Rail transport videos`
* Sound is a plus (horn, engine)

---

## 7. Attribution: What You’ve Just Enabled

Once uploaded, Commons automatically generates attribution like:

> *“Diesel locomotive in hilly countryside” by Your Name, CC BY-SA 4.0*

This is exactly what you’ll later:

* Track in your `resources.html`
* See reused on Wikipedia pages
* Possibly hear credited in documentaries

It’s very satisfying.

---

## 8. Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Uploading anything you didn’t create
❌ Adding music to video
❌ Over-processing photos
❌ Writing poetic or vague descriptions
❌ Forgetting categories

---

## 9. Your Train Video Is Special (Quietly)

Railway footage:

* Gets reused a lot
* Ages well
* Has long-term documentary value

You may be surprised where it shows up.

---

## If You’d Like Next

I can:

* Help you **write the exact descriptions & categories** before upload
* Review your **first Commons upload text**
* Show how to **link Commons files back into your GitHub resources page**
* Help you plan a **Commons-first YouTube workflow**

You’re doing this with care and respect — Commons needs more contributors like that 🚆📷
