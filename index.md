Welcome.  
This is where I keep track of what I’m learning about:

- applied machine learning
- practical AI tools and models
- building small, useful SaaS products
- solving problems with code rather than hype

I’m still learning, which means I’ll get things wrong here in public.  
That’s the point — progress is a record of mistakes that kept going.
