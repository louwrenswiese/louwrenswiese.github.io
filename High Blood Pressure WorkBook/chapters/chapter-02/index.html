    <h2>The Mechanics Behind High Blood Pressure</h2>

    <p>
      High blood pressure is rarely a random event. It usually develops when
      one or more parts of the cardiovascular system stop regulating pressure
      efficiently. Blood pressure is the result of interacting systems, not a
      single on–off switch.
    </p>

    <h3>1. The Heart — Pump Strength and Rate</h3>

    <p>
      The heart affects blood pressure through how forcefully it contracts and
      how fast it beats. When either increases for prolonged periods, pressure
      rises.
    </p>

    <h3>2. The Arteries — Diameter and Flexibility</h3>

    <p>
      Healthy arteries expand with each heartbeat. Narrowed or stiff arteries
      cannot absorb pressure efficiently, forcing blood pressure higher.

    <h3>3. Blood Volume</h3>

    <p>
      Blood pressure rises as circulating fluid volume increases. Hormonal
      signals, kidney function, and sodium retention all influence this process.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Kidney–Hormone Regulation (RAAS)</h3>

    <p>
      The Renin–Angiotensin–Aldosterone System raises blood pressure during
      dehydration or blood loss, but chronic activation can keep pressure
      unnecessarily high.

    <h3>5. Nervous System Influence</h3>

    <p>
      Chronic activation of the sympathetic nervous system raises pressure,
      while sustained parasympathetic activity lowers it.

    <h3>Key Concept to Remember</h3>

    <p>
      High blood pressure usually results from multiple small stresses acting
      together over time. Addressing several mechanisms gently often works
      better than targeting only one.
