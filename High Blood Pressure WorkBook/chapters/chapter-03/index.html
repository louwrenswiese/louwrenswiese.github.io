    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <h2>Major Causes of High Blood Pressure (Ranked by Impact)</h2>

    <p>
      Not all causes of high blood pressure matter equally. Some have a small
      effect, while others drive pressure persistently upward. This chapter
      ranks the most important contributors based on real-world impact.
    </p>

    <h3>Rank 1: Excess Body Fat (Especially Visceral Fat)</h3>

    <p>
      Visceral fat — fat stored around the organs — is the strongest predictor
      of high blood pressure worldwide. Waist circumference often predicts risk
      better than body weight alone.

    <h3>Rank 2: Insulin Resistance and High-Glycaemic Diets</h3>

    <p>
      Insulin resistance increases sodium retention, inflammation, and arterial
      stiffness, linking blood pressure closely to blood sugar regulation.
    </p>

    <h3>Rank 3: Chronic Stress and Poor Sleep</h3>

    <p>
      Persistent stress and inadequate sleep activate pressure-raising
      hormone systems throughout the day.
    </p>

    <h3>Rank 4: High Sodium / Low Potassium Imbalance</h3>

    <p>
      Low potassium intake often turns normal salt intake into a problem by
      impairing sodium excretion.
    </p>

    <h3>Rank 5: Physical Inactivity</h3>

    <p>
      Regular movement improves arterial flexibility and lowers resting blood
      pressure, even at moderate intensity.
    </p>

    <h3>Rank 6: Smoking and Chronic Inflammation</h3>

    <p>
      Smoking and ongoing inflammation accelerate arterial stiffness and
      vascular damage.
    </p>

    <h3>Rank 7: Genetics</h3>

    <p>
      Genetics influence baseline risk but rarely determine outcomes on their
      own.
