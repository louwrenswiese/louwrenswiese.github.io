    <h2>What High Blood Pressure Actually Is</h2>

    <p>
      Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your
      arteries as your heart pumps. This pressure is essential for life — without
      it, oxygen and nutrients could not reach your organs and tissues.
    </p>

    <p>
      Problems arise when this pressure stays too high for too long.
      High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, gradually damages the
      arteries and the organs they supply. It is often called the silent killer
      because it rarely causes pain or obvious symptoms.
    </p>

    <h3>How Blood Pressure Is Measured</h3>

    <p>
      Blood pressure is written as two numbers:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Systolic pressure</strong> – the pressure when the heart contracts</li>
      <li><strong>Diastolic pressure</strong> – the pressure when the heart relaxes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For example, a reading of <strong>130/80</strong> means 130 mmHg systolic and
      80 mmHg diastolic.
    </p>

    <h3>Why High Blood Pressure Is Dangerous</h3>

    <p>
      When blood pressure remains high, artery walls stiffen, the heart works
      harder, and damage accumulates throughout the body.
    </p>

    <p>
      High blood pressure is linked to strokes, heart attacks, kidney disease,
      vision loss, and cognitive decline.

    <h3>A Simple Analogy</h3>

    <p>
      Think of your arteries like flexible pipes. When pressure is normal, they
      expand and relax easily. When pressure stays too high, they age prematurely,
      becoming stiff, weak, and prone to failure.
    </p>

    <p>
      High blood pressure rarely announces itself with pain — it simply shortens
      the lifespan of the system.
