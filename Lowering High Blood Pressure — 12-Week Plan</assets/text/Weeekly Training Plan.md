Weekly Training Plan (6 days)
🟢 DAILY (10 minutes) — Foundation for Circulation

Nitric oxide warm-up (boosts vessel dilation)
Repeat twice daily if possible:

Air squats – 20 reps

Arm swings overhead – 20 reps

Standing march raising knees high – 20 reps

Wall push-ups – 20 reps

Keep the pace a bit brisk. Should be slightly breathless at the end.

🚶‍♂️ INTERVAL WALKING – 4 days/week (20–35 minutes)

This is not a stroll. We alternate easy and hard:

After 5-minute warm-up:

Fast walk 2 minutes (almost uncomfortable pace)

Normal walk 2 minutes
Repeat 5–6 cycles
Cool down 3–4 minutes.

If you ever feel 2 minutes is too easy, increase the fast pace, not the time.

Optional spice: hills once a week.

🏋️‍♂️ STRENGTH TRAINING – 2 days/week (25–40 minutes)

Focus on legs, glutes, core — because leg muscle activation drives blood demand and improves artery flexibility.

Do the following:

Circuit A (Day 1):

Chair squat (or supported squat) – 3 × 10–15

Step-ups (on 20–30 cm step) – 3 × 10 each leg

Standing dumbbell press (or water bottles) – 3 × 12

Plank on knees – 3 × 20–30 seconds

Circuit B (Day 2):

Lunge or split squat holding a chair – 3 × 8–10 each leg

Hip bridge (on back) – 3 × 12–15

Bent-over row (resistance band or bottles) – 3 × 12

Side plank (knees) – 2 × 20–30 seconds each side

Progression rule:
When an exercise becomes easy, increase the range of motion or speed slightly, not the weight.

📌 Once a week (optional)

Balance training (3–5 minutes)

Stand on one leg for 20–30 seconds each

Heel-to-toe walk 2 lengths of room

Balance training improves nerve health, lowers fall risk, and supports blood flow by compensating muscle activation.

Diet: Target Belly Fat + Arterial Flexibility
🔴 Avoid

Sugary cereals, breads, pastries

Fruit juice (whole fruit is fine)

Processed carbs at night (pasta, rice, white bread)

🟢 Use Instead

Eggs + spinach or rocket breakfast

Meat, fish, beans, veg at lunch

Light evening meal: soup, salad, omelette, sardines, tuna, lean meat, or vegetables

🎯 Add vascular foods 4–5 days/week
Food	Benefit
Beetroot (boiled or juice)	raises nitric oxide
Spinach / rocket / kale	nitrate → arterial dilation
Tuna/sardines/salmon	anti-inflammatory omega-3
Nuts (almonds/walnuts)	reduce artery stiffness
Olive oil	replaces bad fats
💧 Hydration

Drink water before exercise (not gallons later). Dehydration stiffens vessels temporarily.

Optional Supplements

Safe for most 75-year-olds (ask doctor only if on medication):

Magnesium citrate or glycinate 200–300 mg daily

Vitamin D3 1000–2000 IU

Omega-3 fish oil (if not eating fish)

Do not take “testosterone boosters” — they’re scams.
If blood work shows low testosterone, medical TRT is a different matter — but first fix vascular health.
