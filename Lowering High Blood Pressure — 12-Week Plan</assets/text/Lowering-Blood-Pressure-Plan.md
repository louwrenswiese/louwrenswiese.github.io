INTRODUCTION
-------------------------
You found this guide because you want a straightforward, practical programme to help reduce high blood pressure (hypertension) by changing daily habits—food, movement, and stress. This guide strips out fuss and delivers a realistic 12-week plan you can follow, adapt, and keep using. It's made to be short, visual, and action-focused.

This is not a miracle cure. It is a structured, evidence-informed set of actions that tend to lower blood pressure when followed consistently: more daily movement, some strength and interval training, reduced sodium, increased veg, controlled alcohol, and better sleep and stress habits.

-------------------------
HOW TO USE THIS BOOKLET
-------------------------
1. Read the Quick Science Summary.  
2. Do the equipment & shopping checklist.  
3. Print the Progress Tracker or copy it into a notebook.  
4. Follow the weekly plan (you can repeat weeks).  
5. After 12 weeks, review and keep the habits that worked.

Keep your doctor informed and ask about how your medication might need adjustment as your blood pressure improves.

-------------------------
QUICK SCIENCE SUMMARY — BLOOD PRESSURE BASICS
-------------------------
- Blood pressure (BP) has two numbers: systolic / diastolic (e.g., 140/90 mmHg).  
- Lifestyle changes that consistently reduce BP include: weight loss, reduced salt intake, increased physical activity, more vegetables and potassium-rich foods, reduced alcohol, and better sleep/stress management.  
- Even modest regular changes (30 minutes of brisk walking most days, cutting processed food) can produce significant drops in systolic pressure over weeks.

-------------------------
ESSENTIAL EQUIPMENT & SHOPPING LIST
-------------------------
Minimal equipment:
- A reliable home BP monitor (upper-arm type recommended).
- A good pair of walking shoes.
- A mat for floor exercises.
- A resistance band (medium) or a set of light dumbbells (1–5 kg) if available.

Kitchen basics:
- Olive oil, plain oats, canned beans (low salt), brown rice or whole-grain pasta, eggs, tinned salmon or sardines, frozen vegetables, fresh fruit (bananas, apples, berries), nuts (unsalted), garlic, onions, lemons.

-------------------------
DAILY HABITS THAT MATTER
-------------------------
Do these daily:
- Measure BP in the morning and keep a simple log (sitting, rested, same arm).  
- Walk at least 20–40 minutes total (can be split).  
- Aim for 5 servings of veg and 2 servings of fruit daily.  
- Limit added salt: the goal is <5–6 g salt/day (about 1 teaspoon). Avoid packaged foods high in sodium.  
- Limit alcohol to 1–2 standard drinks for men infrequently; 0–1 for women (follow your doctor).  
- Sleep 7–9 hours when possible.  
- Practice 5–10 minutes of a stress-reducing routine (breathing, short meditation) after a walk or before bed.

-------------------------
THE 12-WEEK PLAN — OVERVIEW
-------------------------
Structure:
- Weeks 1–4: Establish baseline, build daily walking habit, cut obvious sources of sodium, start gentle strength work twice a week.  
- Weeks 5–8: Increase intensity slightly: introduce intervals, extend walks, add 1 extra strength session. Improve meal structure (more veg, controlled carbs).  
- Weeks 9–12: Consolidate; pick the strongest routines and increase variation. Begin maintenance plan for long-term.

Daily time: 20–60 minutes depending on week. All sessions are scalable.

-------------------------
WEEK-BY-WEEK PLANS
-------------------------
(Use the Daily Workout Library below for exercise descriptions.)

WEEK 1 — Foundations
- Goal: Start daily movement, reduce high-salt foods, measure BP daily.
- Monday: 20–30 minute brisk walk.
- Tuesday: Bodyweight strength session (20 minutes: squats, push-ups, glute bridge, plank).
- Wednesday: 20–30 minute brisk walk + 5 min breathing routine.
- Thursday: 20 minute walk + mobility (ankle/knee/shoulder).
- Friday: Strength session (repeat Tuesday with slight progression).
- Saturday: 30–40 minute moderate walk (or cycle).
- Sunday: Rest or gentle mobility; meal prep for week.

WEEK 2 — Repeat & Tighten
- Increase walk to 25–35 minutes; reduce processed snacks; aim for 3 portions veg per meal.
- Strength sessions add one extra set or extra reps.

WEEK 3 — Add short intervals
- On two walks add 4 x 30-second faster segments with 90–120 second easy walking between.
- Strength: introduce resistance band rows or light dumbbell rows.

WEEK 4 — Consolidate
- Walk 30–40 minutes most days.
- Strength twice weekly; aim for controlled breathing during lifts.
- Review BP log and patterns (time of day, salt around highs).

WEEK 5 — Increase intensity
- Two days: brisk walk with 6 x 30–45s intervals.
- Strength: add single-leg work (split squats) and push-up progression.
- Diet: swap one grain meal for a bean/veg bowl.

WEEK 6 — Build consistency
- Keep 30–45 minute daily movement. Add one day of hill/walk-short-hills.
- Add a short 10–12 minute bodyweight HIIT once weekly (scaled).

WEEK 7 — Focus on strength (twice weekly)
- Strength sessions target larger muscle groups, 30 minutes each.
- Cardio: steady 40 minute walk plus one interval session.

WEEK 8 — Check-in week
- Repeat favorite workouts; record BP averages; adjust salt/alcohol based on trends.

WEEK 9 — Variety & social
- Join a local walk group or recruit a friend for two sessions this week.
- Try a new recipe that increases veg + potassium (e.g., banana + spinach smoothie).

WEEK 10 — Maintain intensity
- Keep two higher-intensity interval sessions; continue strength.
- Sleep: aim to improve bedtime routine — no screens 30 minutes before bed.

WEEK 11 — Peak consolidation
- Keep volume steady; choose 3 core habits to strictly follow (example: walk 30 min, strength twice, veg each meal).

WEEK 12 — Review & plan forward
- Review the BP log; create a maintenance programme: 3–4 movement days/week, strength twice weekly, daily veg target, reduced salt. Consider repeating this 12-week cycle every year or moving to a maintenance schedule.

DAILY WORKOUT LIBRARY (DESCRIPTIONS)
-------------------------
Brisk Walk: Walk at a pace where you can speak in short sentences but not sing. Aim for 100–130 steps/min.

Intervals (walk-based): After warming up 5–8 minutes, do 30–45 seconds at a faster pace, 90–120 seconds easy walking; repeat 4–8 times. Cool down 5 minutes.

Bodyweight strength (20–30 min): 
- Squats: 3 sets x 10–15 reps. 
- Push-ups (inclined or on knees if needed): 3 sets x 6–12 reps.
- Glute bridge: 3 sets x 12–20 reps.
- Plank: 3 x 20–40 seconds.
- Rows (resistance band or dumbbell): 3 x 10–12 reps.

Light HIIT (10 min, scaled):
- 30 seconds work / 30 seconds rest x 8 rounds; choose step-ups, bodyweight squats, or marching high knees.

Salt & flavour tips:
- Use lemon, garlic, herbs, chili, and spices instead of salt. Rinse canned vegetables/beans to reduce sodium.

-------------------------
PROGRESS TRACKER (COPY OR PRINT)
-------------------------
For each day, log:
- Date:
- Morning BP: systolic/diastolic
- Weight (optional)
- Walk minutes
- Strength session Y/N
- Veg servings
- Alcohol units
- Notes (sleep, stress, unusual food)

After each week, average the morning BP readings and record.

TROUBLESHOOTING & FAQs
-------------------------
Q: My BP isn’t changing after 4 weeks.  
A: Check adherence, sodium intake, and discuss meds with your doctor. Small changes accumulate — look at 12 weeks rather than single weeks.

Q: I feel dizzy during exercise.  
A: Stop, sit down, measure BP if you can, and contact medical help if symptoms persist. Adjust intensity downward.

Q: What about salt substitutes?  
A: Potassium-based salt substitutes can help some people, but check with your doctor if you take potassium-raising medicines.

Q: Can I skip strength work?  
A: Strength is valuable for long-term BP control and metabolic health. Do at least one short session per week if possible.
